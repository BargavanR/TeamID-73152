# Intelligent Pesticide Sprinkling System  
**Determined by the Infection Level of a Plant**  

---

## 📖 Overview  

Excessive and indiscriminate pesticide usage in agriculture leads to soil degradation, water contamination, harm to beneficial insects, and health risks for humans and animals. Traditional pesticide spraying methods treat all plants uniformly—regardless of their actual health status—resulting in chemical waste and environmental damage.

This project aims to build a smart system that:

- Detects the infection level (e.g. healthy, mildly infected, severely infected) of individual plants using AI/ML models  
- Controls an IoT-enabled sprayer to apply pesticide **only when and where needed**, in amounts proportional to infection severity  
- Provides farmers with a user-friendly dashboard to monitor plant health, view trends, and control spraying remotely

## 🎯 Key Features  

- **AI-based Plant Health Detection** — classify plant states from camera or sensor inputs  
- **Precision Spraying** — variable pesticide dosage, targeted spraying  
- **IoT Integration** — sensors (soil moisture, humidity, environment), GPS/geotag mapping  
- **Interactive Dashboard** — real-time maps, charts, alerts, and controls  
- **Trend Analytics & Reporting** — usage vs. effectiveness, cost savings, environmental impact
